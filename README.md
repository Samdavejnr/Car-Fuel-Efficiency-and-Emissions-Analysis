# Car-Fuel-Efficiency-and-Emissions-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between car fuel efficiency and emissions. Using a dataset of various car models, we perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into fuel consumption and emission patterns.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on various car models, including fuel efficiency metrics and emissions data.
# Methodology
1. Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing data normalization.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new columns for analysis, such as fuel efficiency metrics.
3. Data analysis: Employing statistical methods and data visualization techniques to examine the relationship between fuel efficiency and emissions.
# Key Findings
1. Strong positive correlation between fuel efficiency and emissions reduction.
2. Cars with higher fuel efficiency tend to have lower emissions.
3. Significant differences in fuel efficiency and emissions across various car models and manufacturers
